        <p>Jamie Halfhide is a very perculiar young man. He is a college student who has had passion and experience in coding since his childhood years and has wanted to develop a game like this since the age of 12. He is an easy-going, patient (if silly) guy and frequently replies back, so contacting him is a great way to receive news and knowledge of Gadget Do-Gooders.</p>
        <p>Mister Halfhide designed the game for teenagers, but prefers to think that it has all-ages appeal</p>
